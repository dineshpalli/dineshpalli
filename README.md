Currently a master‚Äôs thesis researcher at Dr Fabian Theis lab, Helmholtz AI, M√ºnchen. The objective of my project is ‚ÄúEmbedding optimization with deep neural networks for clustering image based flow cytometry data‚Äù. Concurrently, a student intern at Dr Dagmar Kainm√ºller‚Äôs lab, in collaboration with Max Delbr√ºck Center and Charit√© ‚Äì Universit√§tsmedizin Berlin where I work on "Cell deconvolution from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics‚Äù

<h3> Experience </h3>
As a developer, I worked on SquidPy and SquidPy notebooks, tools for the analysis and visualization of spatial molecular data. I have experience using TensorFlow, PyTorch, Numpy, Pandas, Linux and HPC. Additionally, I enjoy hands-on work in the lab.

When I'm not busy being a full-time nerd, you can find me backpackpacking through the wilderness, whipping up some gourmet meals in the kitchen, or devouring the pages of a good book. In my free time, I enjoy engaging in a variety of physical activities, including badminton, skating, and swimming. Just call me a jack-of-all-trades (but hopefully not a master of none!) So whether I'm exploring the great outdoors, whipping up a tasty meal, or hitting the books (or badminton courts), I'm always up for a new adventure.
