### Hi there 👋

<!--
**dineshpalli/dineshpalli** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

I am Dinesh Palli, a student of M. Sc Plant Sciences at the LMU, München. Currently a master’s thesis researcher at Dr Fabian Theis lab, Helmholtz AI, München. The objective of my project is “Embedding optimization with deep neural networks for clustering image based flow cytometry data”. Concurrently, a student intern at Dr Dagmar Kainmüller’s lab, in collaboration with Max Delbrück Center and Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin where I work on "Cell deconvolution from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics”.

As a developer, I worked on SquidPy and SquidPy notebooks, tools for the analysis and visualization of spatial molecular data. I have experience using TensorFlow, PyTorch, Numpy, Pandas, Linux and HPC. Additionally, I enjoy hands-on work in the lab.

When I'm not busy being a full-time nerd, you can find me backpackpacking through the wilderness, whipping up some gourmet meals in the kitchen, or devouring the pages of a good book. In my free time, I enjoy engaging in a variety of physical activities, including badminton, skating, and swimming. Just call me a jack-of-all-trades (but hopefully not a master of none!) So whether I'm exploring the great outdoors, whipping up a tasty meal, or hitting the books (or badminton courts), I'm always up for a new adventure.
